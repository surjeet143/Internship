When you stand at the base and look up, you really do have to crane your neck to see the top. It is an amazing achievement however it was built. I was told by one of the more authoritative guides that the most commonly held belief is that after the base stones were laid, sand was used to cover each gradient, such that the sleds were able to glide to each level with a much reduced gradient than trying to drag them over the steps.

Is it possible that the pyramids were made by an even older civilization and the Egyptians just repurposed them for tombs?

It explains why the pyramids were built next to the river for the supply of water needed for the molds.

I mean, I remember as a small child when we used to play with large rocks. It did not take us very long to figure out that the easiest way to move them was by trying to flip them over from side to side. Of course we also realized that stones that were squares were harder to move than stones with rounded corners. I mean, once you realize that rolling an object is an easier way to move a heavy object than dragging it across the floor and that the rounder the object is the easier it is to roll it... then you have pretty much discovered the wheel. I mean, there must have been some religious or ideological reasons that prevented these cultures from using wheels just as a consequence of normal human intuition.

They caught the ruling power and put the lion people into torture camps and slavery. It was another country that fell victim to the second wave of loss of power of the lion people who ruled the entire world at that time. Moses liberated some lions and brought to a hilly area called Israel as Yudew (Jews). Looking at the history of Sri Lanka, about 1200 years after the incident, the Lions people gradually resurfaced. Later Alexander the Great liberated the lion people imprisoned in various kingdoms scattered throughout the world. But one of his main target, getting the royal families of lion people in north India ( Lord Buddha\\'s relatives)  free was failed before the cruelty of then king Karawala and giving the war up for the sake of lives of imprisoned people. Later they were liberated by Emperor Dewanampiyathisa then King of Lanka the land of origin of lion people, through his colony king Dharma Asoka. Pharaoh never built pyramids. Pyramids were built because lion people can\\'t build water reservoirs in desert unlikely in Sri Lanka. Water reservoirs, as well as Pyramids, activate some nuclear process on the land is a big help for maintaining the levitation power of spiritual lives of lion people(flying lions or Yaksha or Isi).\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nHiranmoy Ghosh\\n4 months ago\\n3:08 quick correction inside is made out of granite stone and outside is made out of lime stone\\n1\\nREPLY\\nDevin Thebeau\\n1 month ago\\nsomeone should take a powerwasher to it\\nREPLY\\nPaul Taylor\\n1 month ago\\nZahi Hawas redux.

Without lights at 12 hours a day it\\'s take 4 million people at 80 years a piece to just cut the stones. Factor in they did not live 80 years and closer to 40 and your at 8 million people doing nothing but sawing 12 hours a day for 40 years. Given they could start sawing at 5 and were too old to saw 35-40 do to hard labor for 30 years and your at about 10 million peoples lifetimes. And that\\'s running at max efficiency when it comes to cutting the entire time. I\\'m sure moving them miles and miles was much much harder and up the pyramid even harder than that. Now factor in the population was on 1 mil. Just cutting the stone with their entire population would have taken over 400 years. Now logical speaking a max of 1/10th of their population could truly only cut since the rest were for wars food or making tools and transferring the stones etc. Which is more than fair. Itd take them 4000 years under the best of conditions to build one pyramid. It\\'s estimated their population reached a max of 3mil. So at the best it\\'d still take 1000 years. But at the very least 2500 years+ that\\'s at blocks that are 4 feet high. Some were more than 6 feet. Which would drastically increase the time. Almost forgot double that because my math was based off 1 person cutting the stone at a rate of 4 mm.

Several advanced ancient civilizations existed before ours. Earth\\'s history has not developed linearly. Ancient books as the Mahabharata from India and the Popol Vuh from the Maya and others tell us that the earth is suffering from a cycle of seven natural disasters. These disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, floods, earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a bombardment of fiery meteors. Some animals become extinct, mankind hardly survives. These disasters create a cycle of civilizations. Four civilizations live a \\'short\\' period of time and are not numerous. One civilization lives much longer and becomes more numerous. The last longer living civilization vanished 20,000 years ago because of the next recurring, thus predictable, disaster. Near the end of their existence, they were higher developed than our civilization today. To tell us that they existed, they constructed huge monuments like the Great Pyramid in Egypt and other huge constructions around the world. And they constructed survival places mostly high in the mountains. As Machu Picchu in Peru. The only possible cause of such a cycle of disasters can be the ninth planet of our solar system that comes close to the sun and its planets every few thousand years. To learn much more about the cycle of civilizations and its timeline, recurring floods and ancient high tech, read the e-book:\"Planet 9 = Nibiru\" You can read it nicely on every computer, tablet or smartphone.

I have no experience in engineering, but check this out. Of course, you know that the Nile is nearby. Now imagine digging a square hole the height of the pyramids.  Now with the Nile, you divert water to the hole, the stone and then can be lowered into the hole. Fill the inner gap with gravel, and once it is in, you lower the second layer of stone. You then pour the sediment on the inside and then on the outside. From there, you work your way up to the capstone. Remove the inner soil, then remove the dirt from the outside of the pyramid. So instead of working your way upward, you work your way downwards. Since Giza is on a hill, it would be easier to remove the outer hill than to build straight up.\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nView reply\\nsnow man\\n9 months ago\\nThe penitent radar happily refuse because layer semiannually license over a valuable fortnight. reminiscent, apathetic snowman\\nREPLY\\nStealthmann\\n6 years ago\\nHumans were far smarter than the humans we have today\\n3\\nREPLY\\nView 6 replies\\nTeacher Rommel Quilantang\\n11 months ago\\nThe more he explains how the pyramids were made, the more I speculate that aliens 👽 are the ones who really made them\\nREPLY\\nView 2 replies\\ntrong binh duong\\n10 months ago\\nThe forgetful quilt ethnopharmacologically drip because stop expectedly fit amidst a glib fibre. aboard, adaptable handball\\nREPLY\\nArya Kavita Dwadasi\\n11 months ago\\nyou should really make a video on indian temples...they\\'re architectural marvels\\nREPLY\\nView reply\\nSimon Bendix Borregaard\\n11 months ago\\nThey cast it.. you can make sandstone blocks chemically and the geomagnetic polarity of the rocks are all uniform indicating they all set at the same time\\n1\\nREPLY\\nView 2 replies\\nDaniel Rephael\\n3 years ago\\nThe Jews built them\\n5\\nREPLY\\nView 2 replies\\nCaloy\\n9 months ago\\ngod: hey man do /gamemode creative\\nREPLY\\nS Terence\\n9 months ago\\nWas actually surpassed by the Lincoln Cathedral well before the Eiffel Tower\\n1\\nREPLY\\nHaley Weatherall\\n10 months ago\\nThe puzzled result simultaneously tumble because catsup chemically compare down a macho oven. ancient, tiny numeric\\nREPLY\\nSON of Overbook.\\n9 months ago\\n@0.32 you said the Egyptians didn’t have wheels?

Every mountain and canyon was either made then or heavily modified. The pyramids were very likely made pre-Flood. Humans were extremely intelligent pre-Flood and had high technology. There is evidence of pre-Flood atomic wars. Even if all their skyscrapers were made of pure Damascus steel, nothing would be left for us to discover after the Flood.

Then eight blocks can be flipped up on top of the base eight blocks, stacking those into twos, then the base is surrounded by a a further sixteen blocks. At this point you have a perfect three tierd pyramid. If you follow this exact principle you will eventually get a pyramid as grand as Gizaz.

As the pyramid got higher and higher, the sand was carried up and added to the pile, increasing its height.
